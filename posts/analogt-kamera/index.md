Earlier this year I inherited an analouge camera from my grandfather.
Usually I prefer digital tools, because they are space efficient, easy to carry around, and the data they produce can is easy to store and backup.
However, there are also some disadvantages.
My photo library has been steadily growing each year, which recently resulted in me having to buy another external hard drive in order to have enough storage space for backups.
