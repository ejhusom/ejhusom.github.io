I'm deeply fascinated with minimalistic and text-only approaches to web design.
This January I moved to a place where I have to use a cellphone hotspot to
connect to the Internet, and thus I am also very aware of my usage of cellular
data, since I need to pay for every GB that I use. This has made me even more
conscious of how large many common websites are, and how much useless stuff I'm
downloading by just browsing the web.

There seems to be a gaining interest in text-only/low-bandwith websites, as you
can read more about in [this
article](https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2017/text-only-news-sites-are-slowly-making-a-comeback-heres-why/).
This has several advantages, especially for people that live under conditions
with severe limitations on bandwidth. I think it's very cool to see that two
major news sites offer low-bandwith versions of their sites:

- [NPR](https://text.npr.org/)
- [CNN](https://lite.cnn.com/en)

For most mobile phone companies in Norway (as far as I know), it is common to
throttle the bandwidth speed to 64 kbit/s when you have reached your data cap.
If more people and companies started to scale down their websites (or at least
make low-bandwith versions), one could browse the web comfortably at those
kinds of speeds, and websites would be much more accessible. I think this could
be very beneficial, especially for essential content such as news.
