        <p>I'm a sky-/mountain-/trailrunner and a skimountaineer, who loves to spend time in the mountains and in nature.
        At day time I work in research, with a focus on applied machine learning in fields ranging from health and sports to manufacturing.
        On this webpage I post phots, blog posts, projects and other stuff (sometimes in English, other times in Norwegian).</p>
