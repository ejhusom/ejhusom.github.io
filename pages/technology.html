<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>I'm very fond of using technological tools (whether it is hardware, software
or a service) that are open source, ethical and respects the user. Here I
present some of the tools I use and want to recommend to others.</p>

<h3>Social networks</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> (social network).
        This is a decentralized social network that has a lot of the same
        functionality as Twitter has. "Decentralized" in this context means
        that the users are spread across many different servers, and anyone can
        host their own Mastodon server. One of the great advantages of Mastodon
        is that it can connect to a lot of other social networks that uses the
        ActivityPub protocol (read more about that <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/mastodon">here</a>).</li>
    <li><a href="https://lemmy.ml/">Lemmy</a> (link aggregator/social network).
        This is a Reddit-like link aggregator, that is used to create
        communities with specific interests, where people can post links and
        discussions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous software</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> (cloud services). This
        is an alternative to Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud and other
        cloud providers. I host my own Nextcloud server, but there are also
        many providers to choose from, with both free and paid subscriptions.
        Nextcloud has lots of functionality other than only file storage. The
        things I use the most is calendar sync, contacts sync and music
    streaming (enabling streaming your own music collection to all of your
    devices).</li> 
    <li><a href="https://www.digikam.org/">Digikam</a> (photo management
        software). This is a powerful tool for managing photo large libraries.
        It has loads of functionality, including face recognition, metadata
        editor, map of geotags and more.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.goldencheetah.org/">GoldenCheetah</a>
        (training/workout log/analyzer). Extremely powerful application for
        analyzing your workout data. Useful for anyone who uses a sports watch
        to record their workouts (GPS-tracks, heart rate data, power data and
        more). Have been using this for many years, and no other training
        software I have tried (and I have tried a lot) offers the same
        flexibility and functionality.</li>
</ul>
