# Bootstrap

What are the steps of bootstrapping?

---

1. Pick randomly elements $x_i$ among $n$ data points, and allow that some data
  points can be picked several times.

---

2. Calculate mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ for the random selection of
  points.

---

3. Repeat this procedure $k$ times, and record $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ for each time.

---

4. Total variance and total mean are the mean of all the $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$
   recorded for each bootstrap sampling.
