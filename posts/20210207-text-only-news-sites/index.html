<h2>Text-only news sites
</h2>
<h3>07 Feb 2021</h3><p>I’m deeply fascinated with minimalistic and text-only approaches to web design. This January I moved to a place where I have to use a cellphone hotspot to connect to the Internet, and thus I am also very aware of my usage of cellular data, since I need to pay for every GB that I use. This has made me even more conscious of how large many common websites are, and how much useless stuff I’m downloading by just browsing the web.</p>
<p>There seems to be a gaining interest in text-only/low-bandwith websites, as you can read more about in <a href="https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2017/text-only-news-sites-are-slowly-making-a-comeback-heres-why/">this article</a>. This has several advantages, especially for people that live under conditions with severe limitations on bandwidth. I think it’s very cool to see that two major news sites offer low-bandwith versions of their sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://text.npr.org/">NPR</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lite.cnn.com/en">CNN</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For most mobile phone companies in Norway (as far as I know), it is common to throttle the bandwidth speed to 64 kbit/s when you have reached your data cap. If more people and companies started to scale down their websites (or at least make low-bandwith versions), one could browse the web comfortably at those kinds of speeds, and websites would be much more accessible. I think this could be very beneficial, especially for essential content such as news.</p>
