<h2>Shoes</h2>

For those who are interested in running, I hope this page might be helpful when
considering buying new shoes. I try to keep these reviews short and to the
point.

<h3>Arc'teryx Norvan SL</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Category:</strong> Trail running.</li>
    <li><strong>Price:</strong> $160.</li>
    <li><strong>Summary:</strong> Lightweight, durable allround trail running
        shoe. My favourite!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Most important information</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Shallow lugs, works well on dry trails, gravel roads, asphalt and
        treadmill. Not quite suitable for terrain were deeper grip is needed,
        like muddy trails.</li>
    <li>Very lightweight, about 180 gr.</li>
    <li>Relatively minimalistic, might lack the necessary support for
        some.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Durability</h4>
<p>The outer sole lasts forever. I use it all year round on every kind of
terrain (rock, soft trails, hard trails, asphalt, treadmill), and the outer
sole is almost unaffected. The upper mesh is quite durable as well, but it is
very thin (which contributes to the shoe's low weight), and may easily get
rifts.</p>
