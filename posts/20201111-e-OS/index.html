<h2>Testing /e/ OS - an alternative to iOS and Google's Android
</h2>
<h3>11 Nov 2020</h3><p>The smartphone market is largely dominated by to major operating systems: iOS (for iPhones only) and Android. One alternative to this is the <a href="https://e.foundation/">/e/ OS</a>, which can be installed to a <a href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices/">lot of various smartphones</a> (but not iPhones). The slogan of /e/ OS is “Your data is YOUR data!”, and the idea behind it is to offer an operating system that does not harvest your data and is designed for letting you control your own data. I really like this concept, and I think it is about time that we get a viable alternative iOS and Android from Google.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p><img src="posts/20201111-e-OS/phone.png" alt="/e/ OS startup screen." /> <em>/e/ OS startup screen.</em></p>
<p>The installation of /e/ OS might seem complex for those who do not have experience with running commands from the command line or have dabbled with these kinds of things before. This is probably the biggest hurdle standing in the way of making /e/ OS an operating system that is ready for the masses. If the installation process was smoother, it would be much easier for the general public to step away from the privacy invasive operating system from Google.</p>
<p>I tested /e/ OS on a Samsung Galaxy S5; the installation instructions were very clear, and everything went as expected as I just followed through the step-by-step procedure</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p><img src="posts/20201111-e-OS/homescreen.png" alt="/e/ OS home screen." /> <em>/e/ OS home screen.</em></p>
<p>The home screen seems very inspired by the iOS home screen, but apart from that, I think Android users will feel more at home than iPhone users. The Settings-app for example, uses a typical Android layout, so I had some trouble finding my way through all the settings and options initially (I have been an iPhone-user for the last years)</p>
<p><img src="posts/20201111-e-OS/settingsscreen.png" alt="/e/ OS settings screen." /> <em>/e/ OS settings screen.</em></p>
<p>The /e/ OS comes with its own app store called “Apps”. If the app you want does not appear there, one could download other app stores, for example “F-Droid”, which contains only free and open source apps, or “Aurora”, which contains more mainstream apps that you would usually find in Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store.</p>
<p><img src="posts/20201110-e-OS/appstores.png" alt="Examples of app stores available in /e/ OS." /> <em>Examples of app stores available in /e/ OS.</em></p>
<p>There is not much more to say about the general usage, because everything works just as I expected it to work, and I could use almost all the apps I usually do (see "Disadvantages below for those that didn’t work).</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<p>I can find only two main disadvantages with /e/ OS for me personally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vipps (a Norwegian banking application) cannot be installed.</li>
<li>It is very difficult to get Snapchat working.</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding Snapchat: It is apparently possible to install and log in, according to <a href="https://community.e.foundation/t/impossible-to-log-in-snapchat/5445/11">this forum thread</a>, but not without quite a lot of work. I have not personally tested the approach.</p>
<p>Problems such as this (not being able to install a certain application) will certainly be a deal breaker for some, and it is worth taking a look at <a href="https://community.e.foundation/t/editable-list-of-apps-that-work-or-do-not-work-with-microg/21151">this list</a> over those apps that reportedly won’t work in /e/ OS. The most notable apps you have to live without (at the time of writing) are Snapchat, Uber, Netflix and Pokemon Go.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am very happy that there exists an alternative to iOS and Google’s Android, and that the developers behind it want to make this as accessible as possible to everyone, not only those with deep technological knowledge and interest. Even though there are some applications that do not work on /e/ OS, it is a joy to use an operating system that is designed for privacy and does not harvest information about you.</p>
